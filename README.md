# Deployment description:

For deploying the Dockerized multithreaded Spring application, I would consider using AWS as the cloud service provider.

I would first make sure that the application is fully Dockerized and works locally as expecte, then I would choose one of the many ways to run containers on AWS, such as Amazon Elastic Container Service. From AWS' management console I would be able to upload my Dockerfile along with my entire project and deploy it from there. Amazon ECS should handle the deployment process, from pulling the Docker image to starting the container. Once the app has deployed, I will be able to monitor the application's status from there.
