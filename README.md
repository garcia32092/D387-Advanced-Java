# Deployment description:

For deploying the Dockerized multithreaded Spring application, I would consider using AWS as the cloud service provider.

Firstly, I would make sure that the application is fully Dockerized and works locally as expected. Second, I would log into AWS and set up my an IAMs account by creating an EC2 use case role to launch an EC2 Linux instance. After properly configuring and launching the Linux instance, I can start a session with the Linux instance. I can then use Docker commands to install and start Docker within the instance. Once Docker is properly installed and working within the instance, I can finally login using my Docker credentials to pull my Docker image from Docker Hub and deploy the image in a container.
